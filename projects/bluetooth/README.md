## Bootloader ##

Bluetooth Mesh projects do not include bootloaders by default, but a bootloader is required for device firmware upgrade (DFU) and reliable field updates. To ensure your mesh application runs correctly, you must either:

- Flash the appropriate bootloader to your device, or
- Remove DFU functionality from your project.

If your mesh application does not require DFU, you can remove the Bootloader Application Interface software component and its dependencies. This places your application code at the start of flash memory, eliminating the need for a bootloader. Note that removing DFU functionality will prevent future firmware upgrades via DFU.

To add a bootloader, you have two options:

- **Create and flash a bootloader project:**
    Build and flash a bootloader suitable for your device:
  - For Series 1 devices, use a Bluetooth in-place OTA DFU or Internal Storage bootloader.
  - For Series 2 devices, use a Bluetooth Apploader OTA DFU bootloader.

- **Use a pre-compiled demo:**
    Running a pre-compiled demo from the Launcher view will flash both the bootloader and application images to your device. Afterward, you can overwrite the demo application with your own image, while the bootloader remains intact.
  - For mesh projects, use the Bluetooth Mesh - Light or Bluetooth Mesh - Switch demo.

**Important Notes:**

- When flashing your application, use the `.hex` or `.s37` output files. Flashing `.bin` files may erase the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first and second stage bootloaders must be flashed. This can be done by flashing the `-combined.s37` file generated by the bootloader project.
- On Series 2 devices, mesh example projects require a Bluetooth Apploader OTA DFU bootloader by default. This bootloader requires significant flash space and shifts the application start address. The shift is managed automatically by the Apploader Support for Applications software component, which is installed by default. If you choose a different bootloader type, remove this component to revert the application start address. Note that removing it disables Apploader OTA DFU, but you can still implement application-level OTA DFU by installing the Application OTA DFU software component.
